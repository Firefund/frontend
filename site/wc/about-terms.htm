						<p class="f-one-liner f-one-liner_size_big">Our objective is to ensure the privacy of our users against any type of political opression and repression.</p>
						<br>
						That being said, we are a non-profit, activist-driven initiative, and we do not have the developer resources to sufficiently test and develop our own software for all our current need of data analysis and data handling. This means, that no matter how lean, secure and anonymous firefund.net is, your privacy still rests on the policies of the relating software. 
						<br><br>
						Currently these external vendors are: 
						<br><br>
						<ol class="f-list">
							<li>Stripe, as a credit card payment processor,</li>
							<li>Piwik, as a data analysists,</li>
							<li>SendGrid, as a newsletter processor,</li>
							<li>Youtube (Google), as a video content manager,</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
						We will account for these individually and link for further information further down. 
						</p>
						<p>
						We will also account for our policy in terms of communication internally and externally. 
						</p>
						<p>
						We will finally inform about certain general pitfalls for your data privacy, when using our site, and how to avoid them. 
						</p>
						<br>

						<h2 class="f-text__heading">Feedback and contributions</h2>
						<p>
						FIRE<span>FUND</span> (www.firefund.net) and (in the future) our Tor site (www.firefundezoptrah.onion) are essentially open-source community-driven ressources - and any feedback, questions, proposals are much appreciated. 
						<br><br>
						But in reality, the most valuable method is direct action - so if you wish to change aspects of our privacy policies and data handling systems, then please get in contact by firefund@riseup.net or reach out to our github organisation:

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">About the use of cookies in general</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					FIRE<span>FUND</span>.net does not on its own use cookies. However, we use different vendors and applications to support the infrastructure of the site that implement the use of cookies. 
					</p>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					Cookies are small files saved to the user's computer hard drive that track, save and store information about the user's interactions and usage of the website. If you wish to deny the use and saving of cookies from this website, you should take necessary steps within your web browsers security settings to block all cookies from this website.
					</p>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					However, blocking the use of cookies from this website, may give some problems in paying with credit cards.
					</p>

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">1. Stripe</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					In short, by donating with credit cards, FIRE<span>FUND</span>.net and affiliated initiatives of the platform are not able to ensure your anonymity or your safety against legal prosecution. Making donations with credit cards should be considered a non-secret act of solidarity, that rests upon your own responsibility. The FAKKEL Foundation, the platform (www.firefund.net) or the affiliated initiatives and activists cannot take responsibility for the legality of your donations. 
					<p class="f-text__text">
					If you choose to donate to a campaign with your credit card, you will use the Stripe application. Stripe is a payment provider, that handles the data from your input when you donate, verifies the payment, withdraws the donation from your bankaccount and transfers the donation to FIRE<span>FUND</span> and/or directly to the receiving party. 
					</p>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					By making a donation with your credit card, you are indirectly verifying your identity and exposing this to Stripe, your bank and possibly governmental institutions. If your donation is illegal, either because of the money being donated is illegal, or because the initiative you are supporting are illegal in any way, then there is no way for FIRE<span>FUND</span> to ensure you of your safety against legal repression. 
					</p>

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">2. Piwik</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					Piwik is a free and open source web analytics application. FIRE</span>FUND.net will use Piwik to gather data on the usage of the platform, in order to improve the platform and to improve the organizing of campaigns for international solidarity. 
					<p class="f-text__text">
					Currently, there is no active implementation of Piwik on FIRE<span>FUND</span>.net. This privacy policy will be updated before we start using Piwik. 
					</p>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					The main reason we are using Piwik as a provider of data from the usage of the website, is that with Piwik, we as a platform keep control of the data and we will never sell, give or share it with others. 
					</p>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					Read more on the Piwik privacy on <a href="http://piwik.org/docs/privacy/">their website</a>
					</p>

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">3. SendGrid</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					If you choose to sign up for our newsletter, or if you input your email in any other field on the website, it will most likely end up in our database hosted by SendGrid. When we use SendGrid to distribute newsletters, 'call to actions', donation confirmations or other kinds of emails, we will (via. SendGrid) include various types of tracking facilities to gather data on the usage of our newsletters. This might include data on; the opening of emails, forwarding of emails, clicking on the links within the emails, times, dates and frequency of activity and interaction with the emails in general. 
					</p>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					As with the rest of the external vendors, we will never give out access to these databases of data to any third parties, and we will do what we can to anonymize the data when it is needed. You will always have the option of unsubscribing the newsletter, via. a link in the bottom of all newsletters. 
					</p>

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">4. Youtube</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
					When embedding videos from youtube, and /or other video content providers, we cannot currently account for what kind of information about you as a user, that Youtube (and thereby Google) has access to. 
					</p>


					<h2 class="f-text__heading">External links and social media</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
						We can only take responsability for your security and anonymity while visiting this site. We will have links to external websites posted frequently and we cannot assure the security meassures taken on these sites. Same goes for various links and icons directing you to social media platforms. We use the infrastructure of different social media platforms to host discussions, create community, reach out to a broader audience and to mobilise. When engaging in communication with us or other people in relation to FIRE<span>FUND</span>, keep in mind that our privacy policy does not apply there. 
					</p>
					<h2 class="f-text__heading">Shortened links</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
						When clicking on shortened links (such as this one: http://bit.ly/zyVUBo) ) published on social media by FIREFUND, be it twitter, facebook or reddit, please be aware that profiles and handles on social media are often the subject to spam and hacking. We are doing what we can to only publish trustable, informative links, but we are not untouchable, the profiles we manage on social media can also experience spam or hacking, so let this be a disclaimer: if you click on a bad link from our profile(s) it is not intended, and we would apprecieate being informed about it.

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">Direct Donations</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
						When donating to a campaign using direct donations the following terms applies: <br>

						A. All donations are directly transferred to our bank account when the transaction is completed with our payment provider.
						B. Donations can be cancelled upon request, if the request is explicit and is delivered on E-mail before the crowdfunding campaign has ended and /or before the goal for the crowdfunding campaign is reached.
						C. Refunds will be the total donations minus 5 % to cover fees for our payment providers.
						D. All refunds will be in current prizes, and firefund.net, firefund.org, firefund.com or the FAKKEL Foundation cannot be held responsible for any value fluctuations.
					</p>

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">Pledged donations</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
						Crowfunding campaigns using pledged donations allows users to pay with credit card, to pledge a donation, without the money being transferred before the goal of the campaign is met with sufficient pledges. Users can abort a pledged donation by E-mail to firefund@riseup.net, and if the E-mail is received before the exact time and date the goal is reached, then the donation will be cancelled. NOOOO. This is open for hackers. 
					</p>

					<h2 class="f-text__heading">Bitcoins</h2>
					<p class="f-text__text">
						For donations paid with bitcoins, we are not yet capable of pledged donations. Instead we will refund the amount of bitcoins to the current value on the day of the refund to the bitcoin address we recieved it from.
						All refunds will be in current prizes, and firefund.net, firefund.org, firefund.com or the FAKKEL Foundation cannot be held responsible for any value fluctuations..

					<p class="f-text__text">

						This is a non-profit webiste, which means that we do not wish to hand out any surplus to investors who do nothing more than sit around and wait to get rich of of your hard work.
						The use of the site is free, and no one will expect to earn money off your project. However, costs related to completing a crowdfunding campaign, must be provided by the ones fundraising.
						Regardless, FIREFUND do have some expenses connected to the running of the site, among others making sure servers are running, payments go through and that the site stays secure. Thus it is possible for supporters to allow a percentage of donations go to FIREFUND to help us cover these costs.
						FIREFUND does not require a fixed administrative fee, and we will do our best to keep the site running regardless of our budget, but we still encourage everyone donating to campaigns, to keep these expences in mind and hope you will help secure the continuity of this platform.
						If we should find ourselves in the situation where we generate a surplus, this will be reinvested in FIREFUND or invested in other progressive initiatives that supports the general purpose of this project.
